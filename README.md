## My Blog

[preview blog](https://evansnowly.github.io/)
This blog serves as a platform for me to share my technical knowledge and experiences. Here, you'll find a collection of:

* **Algorithm Notes:** Deep dives into data structures and problem-solving strategies for platforms like LeetCode, often implemented in Go. 
* **Blog Posts:** Articles covering a wide range of topics in the tech world, including networking, concurrency, frameworks (gin, gorm, grpc), middleware (redis, mysql), and cloud-native technologies (docker, k8s). (
* **Projects:** Showcase of smaller projects I've built during my learning journey. 

This site is built with VitePress, a modern static site generator. Feel free to explore the content and learn something new!

**Stay tuned** for new content as I continue to explore and document my technical adventures.
