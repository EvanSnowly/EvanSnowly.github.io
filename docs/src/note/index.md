# Exploring Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

Welcome to my algorithm notes series, where we delve into the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques using Go. In this blog, I'll cover essential data structures like maps, lists, and trees, alongside popular algorithms such as dynamic programming, recursion, sorting algorithms, and graph algorithms. Additionally, I'll share my journey of tackling LeetCode problems and documenting solutions:

## Data Structures in Go

### Map

Maps in Go provide a convenient way to store key-value pairs. They are versatile and efficient for lookups, inserts, and deletions. Throughout this series, I'll demonstrate how to leverage maps to solve various problems efficiently.

### List

Lists, especially linked lists, are fundamental in understanding memory allocation and traversal. We'll explore how to implement and utilize lists in Go, focusing on both singly and doubly linked variants.

### Tree

Trees play a crucial role in hierarchical data representation. From binary search trees to AVL trees, we'll implement these structures in Go and discuss their applications in solving real-world problems.

### Graph

Graphs are versatile structures used to model relationships between objects. We'll cover graph representations (adjacency list and adjacency matrix) and algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) in Go.

## Algorithms in Go

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a powerful technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. We'll explore dynamic programming concepts and implement solutions in Go.

### Recursion

Recursion is a fundamental approach in algorithm design, where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. We'll dive into recursive algorithms and their applications in Go.

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are essential for arranging data in a specific order. We'll implement and compare various sorting algorithms such as quicksort, mergesort, and heapsort in Go.

### Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms help find elements within data structures. We'll implement algorithms like binary search and discuss their efficiency and use cases in Go.

## LeetCode Problem-Solving Journey

I'll also share my journey of solving LeetCode problems using Go. Each problem presents a unique challenge, and we'll discuss strategies, optimizations, and insights gained through solving these problems.
